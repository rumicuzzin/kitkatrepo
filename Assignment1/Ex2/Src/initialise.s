@ enable the clocks for peripherals (GPIOA, C and E)
enable_peripheral_clocks:
	LDR R0, =RCC  @ load the address of the RCC address boundary (for enabling the IO clock)
	LDR R1, [R0, #AHBENR]  @ load the current value of the peripheral clock registers
	ORR R1, 1 << GPIOA_ENABLE | 1 << GPIOC_ENABLE | 1 << GPIOE_ENABLE  @ 21st bit is enable GPIOE clock, 17 is GPIOA clock
	STR R1, [R0, #AHBENR]  @ store the modified register back to the submodule
	BX LR @ return from function call



@ initialise the discovery board I/O (just outputs: inputs are selected by default)
initialise_discovery_board:
	LDR R0, =GPIOE 	@ load the address of the GPIOE register into R0
	LDR R1, =0x5555  @ load the binary value of 01 (OUTPUT) for each port in the upper two bytes
					 @ as 0x5555 = 01010101 01010101
	STRH R1, [R0, #MODER + 2]   @ store the new register values in the top half word representing
								@ the MODER settings for pe8-15
	BX LR @ return from function call
